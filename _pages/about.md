I am Professor of English Linguistics at Université Paris Cité, UFR d’Etudes anglophones and a member of the [ALTAE lab](https://clillac-arp.u-paris.fr/annuaire/ballier-nicolas/). My background (PhD) is in the epistemology of linguistics. I have a strong interest in eighteenth century representation of the Phonetics of English and in digital humanities. My research investigates the third revolution of grammatisation: what computers do to linguistic data. I have worked on computational analyses of spoken and written learner data. My recent research focuses on the interpretability of neural machine translation and the representation of speech in Whisper, an audio large language model.
