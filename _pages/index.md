I am a Professor of English Linguistics at Universit√© Paris Cit√© in the [ALTAE Lab](https://clillac-arp.u-paris.fr/annuaire/ballier-nicolas/). My work focuses on interpretability and robustness of NLP applications based on Large Language Models, as well as their sociotechnical impacts. 

I hold a PhD in Computational Linguistics from the [University of Tokyo](https://www.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/eng_site/info/academics/grad/lis/)), followed by postdocs in Machine Learning for NLP ([University of Massachusetts](https://text-machine.cs.uml.edu/) (Lowell)) and Social Data Science ([University of Copenhagen](https://sodas.ku.dk/)).
