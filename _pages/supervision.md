## Habilitation Thesis mentorship

Send me an email for a zoom session. The Université Paris Cité current requirements are listed [here](https://u-paris.fr/habilitation-a-diriger-des-recherches-hdr/) Be aware of the timeline and requirements.



## PhD supervision

See the required [documents for PhD registration/grants applications](https://web.archive.org/web/20221208164550/http://ed132.ed.univ-paris-diderot.fr/doku.php?id=applying_for_a_doctoral_contract_en)  and in [French](https://ed622.u-paris.fr/contrats-doctoraux-ed-622/)

I am potentially available for supervision on AI research for education, in relation to my research topics, please do [take a look at my publications](https://clillac-arp.u-paris.fr/annuaire/ballier-nicolas/) for example on the analysis of current frameworks developed with colleagues, see [paper submission in French](https://github.com/nballier/nballier.github.io/blob/master/_publications/2025-01-15-EIAH2025submission.pdf). 

**Analytics for Language Learning**
In relation to the AI-generated dashboard we have created for the [A4LL project](https://sites-recherche.univ-rennes2.fr/lidile/articles/a4all/), we are looking for PhD candidates with some background in psycholinguistics to conduct field research on UX (User experience) with this platform and dashboard system. For candidates who are more theoretically grounded, we need to carry out an analysis of the metalinguistic comments for the processing of the dashboard metrics. We also would like to compare the current plot-based interface with metalinguistic feedback. For more downtream tasks, we also search for a candidate able to test the relevance of LLMs to produce exercises in relation with the linguistic issues diagnosed by the system. 


**Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis**
I can also supervise PhD students willing to test what I call the technical 'affordance' of Whisper, analyzing more specifically the ability to properly diagnose mispronunciations on the basis of the investigation of the subtoken and probabilities predicted by Whisper. This implies for example the analysis of a potential value of the mspronunciation thresholds  to be determined for different types of subtokens. If you want this paragraph to make sense, please [read this paper](https://hal.science/hal-04911934v1)


**biases in speech tokenisers**
In relation to our project on  


**the linguistic "knowledge" of LLMs**
I also elaborate on an epistemological line of research on the "knowledge" of LLMs. See our draft here for an example of potential investigations of [phonological knowledge](https://hal-univ-paris.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-04927138v1)


** Keystroke logging modelling**
Last, for Neural modelling of Keylogs: for students (preferably) with a background in data science, I am looking for applicants likely to investigate neural models for keylogging data for the dataset we collected in our Deep learning for Language Assessment project. See our paper publihed at [LREC2024](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.938.pdf)



## MA supervision
Our current brochure for the [MA in English linguistics](https://paris-gsl.org/masters/english-linguistics) is [here](https://cloud.parisdescartes.fr/index.php/s/Rbcdrk6pdkEKtF4), but do expect changes for 2025-2026. We are part of the [Paris Graduate School of Linguistics](https://paris-gsl.org/index.html). See our [grants for international students](https://u-paris.fr/en/call-for-applications-smarts-up-graduate-schools-incoming-mobility-scholarships-for-masters-students/)


**Areas of expertise**: neural machine translation, automatic approaches to learner data (written/spoken data), corpus phonology : L2 pronunciation/prosody/varieties of English within a corpus-based/quantitative/automatic/AI perspective, epistemology of linguistic data science


**Possible topics for 2025-2026**:
AI for speech scoring / Large Language Models (LLMs) for learner feedback / Probing the phonological representations of LLMs

**AI for L2 speech scoring**
We are using Whisper to analyse learner phonetic realisations, your role will be to contribute to the analysis of the Whisper outputs. [simple version](https://aclanthology.org/2023.icnlsp-1.30.pdf) [more complex background](https://aclanthology.org/2024.nlp4call-1.2.pdf) 

**Large Language Models (LLMs) for learner feedback** 
(For future teachers of English, The actionability of complexity metrics): at the intersection of second language acquisition (SLA) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), this project invites you to analyse the automatic measurements (metrics) we devised for the [A4LL project](https://sites-recherche.univ-rennes2.fr/lidile/articles/a4all/). We designed a system that automatically analyses texts written by learners. Your role will be to write the corresponding prompts and test the reliability of some of the metrics we implemented.

**Probing the phonological representations of LLMs**
Using Whisper, you will analyse the representations encoded in this Large Language Model analysing the transcriptions and the corresponding speech signal. See [this paper](https://aclanthology.org/2024.icnlsp-1.15.pdf).
